NFO:

How to make this script work:
1: Start the game and choose "Normal Start"
2: Pick a FEMALE Character! THIS IS CRITICAL!
3: Press enter through the options, changing nothing.
4: Once you are in the actual game, activate the "Character Stats" script.
5: Now you can enter "restart" and either load your save or start however you want.

Things to remember:
- You have to do the steps each time you reload the game!
- If you deactivate the script and the "flesh volume" is not 3 anymore, the script WON'T work!
- If you load a save instead of a new female character, before activatiing the script, this will propably NOT work!
- This is a workaround, not a proper method. Do not expect it to work forever!

Help, I did the HowTo and the Pointers only shows weird numbers! / Script does not open!
1: Close the game.
2: Restart it and attach Cheat engine.
3: Follow the HowTo, but after step 3 do NOT activate the script!
4: In the game, do a few commands that don't change anything (wait, look, inv, x self )
5: Now activate the script.
